# Building a Quiz from Scratch

Are you a nerd like me? Do you love anything and everything fantasy and sci-fi related? Well test your knowledge on some of my absoulute favorite movies, video games and TV shows as this week's assignment had us creating our very own multiple choice question quiz using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Not only does this quiz contain fun questions, but also follows all technical requirments such as keeping score of what answers the user chooses, deducting 10 seconds off the timer for every wrong answer chosen and the ability to put your name and score into the database to keep track of high scores!

The quiz begins once the user clicks on "Start Quiz", the first question is shown and the timer of 45 seconds begins counting down.
When the user gets an answer right, their score goes up by 1. However, if the user chooses the wrong answer, 10 seconds is deducting from the timer. 
When the user is done with all the questiions, a score page is shown where the user can see how well they did in the quiz and leave their name and score.

# Overview
This project was both a challenge and quite fun to make. The hardest obstacle I came to was trying to get the scores to save in local storage, and I did not fully get it to work all the way. However, I feel like the rest of the quiz came out quite strong. I really enjoy the personalization of this assignment and getting to style a quiz from scratch was fun to me and I got to let my nerd flag fly!
