Building a Quiz from Scratch

Are you a nerd like me? Do you love anything and everything fantasy and sci-fi related? Well test your knowledge on some of my absoulute favorite movies, video games and TV shows as this week's assignment had us creating our very own multiple choice question quiz using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Not only does this quiz contain fun questions, but also follows all technical requirments such as keeping score of what answers the user chooses, deducting 10 seconds off the timer for every wrong answer chosen and the ability to put your name and score into the database to keep track of high scores!
